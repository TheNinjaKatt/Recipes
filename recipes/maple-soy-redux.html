    <img src="" alt="Bottled Maple Soy Reduction">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe I learned while working at a ski resort in Utah.</p>
    <p>It's incredibly simple, using only 6 ingredients. A blender is recommended, however, isn't required if the solid ingredients are finely minced.</p>
    <p>A rich sauce that pairs well with chicken, as well as other proteins, and rice. Be sure to experiment and discover more pairings as this is a versatile condiment.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced sodium Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>Real Maple Syrup (<em>Syrup made with corn syrup, although cheaper, is unfit for this recipe as it burns easily. Trust.</em>)</li>
      <li>Ginger Root</li>
      <li>Shallots</li>
      <li>Green Onions</li>
      <li>High-Temp Cooking Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Chop (or mince, if not using a blender) peeled ginger, shallots, and green onions.</li>
      <li>Sautee solid ingredients with oil in a saucepan until aromatic.</li>
      <li>Add equal parts Maple Syrup and Soy Sauce to the saucepan.</li>
      <li>Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
      <li>Reduce to simmer until sauce is reduced by half.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and let cool until warm.</li>
      <li>Puree in blender until smooth. (Unless solid ingredients were minced.)</li>
      <li>Pour into bottles/storage containers and let cool to room temperature before refrigerating.</li>
    </ol>
